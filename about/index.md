## Hi there!

My name is Josip Valencic and I'm currently studying Computer Science (BSc FHO) at the [University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil](http://www.hsr.ch).

This blog was created with GitHub Pages and Jekyll, a static site generator, and will contain some of my projects.
My projects can also be found on [GitHub](http://github.com/{{ site.owner.github }}).
